# BIGMACDECK


![BigMacDeck-screenshot](BigMacDeck-5.4/graphics/decks/BigMacDeck.png)

A large, streaming-friendly deck for [Corruption Cards](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=67939) with:
- 197 active cards
- 50 disabled cards
- 8 "bookmarked" cards


Avoiding:
  - Potentially map-breaking cards
  - Special "achievement" style or other cards that can by themselves make gameplay grindy or annoying.
  - Progress-inhibiting or reversing cards.

Just load the [`BigMacDeck-*.pk3`](BigMacDeck-5.4.pk3) (right click to "Save As") after the Corruption Cards PK3 and the deck will be presented along with the defaults:

Voila:

Difficulty progression is disabled by default, but custom mode settings can override this.  Disabling it ensures maximum variety in card selection.  IMO, variety is what makes Corruption Cards great.  For this same reason i use custom mode to offer eight cards:

Eight could be a bit much for streaming, maybe six would be more reasonable using "streamer friendly layout":

Which looks like this:

Creating a custom deck is simple but tedious given the sheer number of cards.  It boils down to creating a `CCARDS.txt` as described [here](https://github.com/CutmanMike/corruptioncards) and plopping that into a `.pk3`.  The folder `BigMacDeck-5.4` mirrors `BigMacDeck-5.4.pk3` - just two files, the `CCARDS.txt` and the BigMacDeck graphic.  In time this repository will house "McDeck", a tool i'm working on to simplify creation and sharing of custom decks.

---

Some cards i've disabled may seem borderline or "not too bad" but keep in mind that due to eggs, random enchantments, deck modifying cards and so on - any card in the deck could pop up at any time.  Possibly annoying card in a possibly annoying scenario is no bueno.
