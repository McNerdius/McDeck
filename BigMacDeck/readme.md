# BIGMACDECK
## v5.4

![BigMacDeck-screenshot](BigMacDeck-5.4/graphics/decks/BigMacDeck.png)

A large, streaming-friendly deck for [Corruption Cards](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=67939).  It disables 58 cards (see below [below](#disabled-cards) for a listing and notes), leaving 197 in play - double the default "Balanced" deck.

Card removal criteria:
  - Potentially map- or run-breaking: making 100% item/kill count impossible, out-of-bounds issues, interfering with advanced mapping techniques, etc.
  - Significant/disproportionate alteration of gameplay, such as "The Ancient One".
  - Adding hostility to the environment in ways that are likely to block progress or eliminate a mapper's intended "safe zones."
  - Reversing or preventing progress due to large or ongoing ressurections/spawns.

Just load the [`BigMacDeck-*.pk3`](BigMacDeck-5.4.pk3) (right click to "Save As") after the Corruption Cards PK3 and the deck will be presented along with the defaults:

Voila:

# Unsolicited Opinions

IMO, variety is what makes Corruption Cards great.  In addition to using a large deck, one can:

- Disable difficulty progression keeps lower tier cards in play throughout the playthrough.  (This deck disables difficulty progression by default, but custom mode settings can override this.)
- Use custom mode to offer eight cards:

Eight could be a bit much for streaming, maybe six would be more reasonable, combined with "streamer friendly layout":

Which looks like this:

# Future Stuff

One feature this deck doesn't take advantage of is custom monster grouping.  This would allow disabling certain buffs on boss monsters.

In time this repository will house "McDeck" (for lack of a better name...), a set of tools i'm working on to simplify creation and sharing of custom decks.  It consists of:
- A CLI to collate and dump assets from Corruption Cards PK3s to a more "consumable" format.  It can be used to generate custom decks but this tedious given 200+ cards.
- A web API to consume dumped data programatically.  For now it has endpoints to provide Decks and Cards (by ID, Base Class, or Type) for the latest version of Corruption Cards.  Search and version selection will be added.
- A site to browse and search Corruption Cards and create custom Decks.  Future versions will allow loading previously customized Decks for further editing, and if there is interest a "Community Decks" page.

# Disabled cards

Some cards i've disabled may seem borderline or "not too bad" but keep in mind that due to eggs, random enchantments, deck modifying cards and so on - any card in the deck could pop up at any time.  Possibly annoying card in a possibly annoying scenario is no bueno.
